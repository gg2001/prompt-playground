If they fly from lake Jim to lake Disney in one season, which is 50 miles apart, then the next season they fly from lake Disney to lake London, 60 miles apart, calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons.\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled. We know that there are 20 birds and they fly from lake Jim to lake Disney, which is 50 miles apart. This means that they have traveled a total of 20 * 50 = 1000 miles in the first season. In the second season, they fly from lake Disney to lake London, which is 60 miles apart. Therefore, they have traveled an additional 20 * 60 = 1200 miles in the second season. Therefore, the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons is 1000 + 1200 = 2200 miles.\n",

If she scored 70 in Music and scored 1/10 less in Maths, what's the total number of marks she scored in all the subjects?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total number of marks Amaya scored. We know that she scored 70 in Music and 1/10 less in Maths, which means she scored 70 - (1/10 * 70) = 63 in Maths. We also know that she scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than she scored in Arts, which means she scored 63 + 20 = 83 in Arts. Finally, we know that she got 10 marks more in Social Studies than she got in Music, which means she scored 70 + 10 = 80 in Social Studies. Therefore, the total number of marks she scored in all the subjects is 70 + 63 + 83 + 80 = 296.\\nAnswer: 296\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Megan pays $16 for a shirt that costs $22 before sales. What is the amount of the discount?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the discount. We first need to find the difference between the original price and the discounted price. We can do this by subtracting the discounted price from the original price. This gives us $22 - $16 = $6. Therefore, the discount is $6.\\nAnswer: $6\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. On Wednesday she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday. How many pencils does she have?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total number of pencils Sarah has. We know that she bought 20 pencils on Monday and 18 more on Tuesday. This means that she has 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she bought triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils she has is 38 + 54 = 92.\\nAnswer: 92\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald. How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the answer. We know that Bridget counted 14 shooting stars, Reginald counted two fewer than Bridget, and Sam counted four more than Reginald. So, we can calculate the average number of shooting stars by adding the number of shooting stars counted by each of them and dividing by 3. This gives us (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14 shooting stars. Therefore, Sam counted 16 shooting stars, which is 2 more than the average number of shooting stars observed by the three of them.\\nAnswer: 2\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: The result from the 40-item Statistics exam Marion and Ella took already came out.

If they fly from lake Jim to lake Disney in one season, which is 50 miles apart, then the next season they fly from lake Disney to lake London, 60 miles apart, calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons.\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons. We first need to calculate the distance traveled by the birds in the first season, which is from lake Jim to lake Disney. Since there are 20 birds, and the distance between the two lakes is 50 miles, the total distance traveled by the birds in the first season is 20 x 50 = 1000 miles. Next, we need to calculate the distance traveled by the birds in the second season, which is from lake Disney to lake London. Since there are still 20 birds, and the distance between the two lakes is 60 miles, the total distance traveled by the birds in the second season is 20 x 60 = 1200 miles. Therefore, the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons is 1000 + 1200 = 2200 miles.\n",

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program appears to be designed to answer various math and logical reasoning tasks by using language models specifically trained for this task. The program takes in a question and provides instructions for the reasoning process, where the user fills in the blanks to come up with the answer. The program then passes the question to the ChainOfThought module, which uses trained language models to analyze the question's text and produce an answer. This process closely resembles how a human would solve a math or logical reasoning problem. The program in this example successfully calculates the number of pencils Sarah has, the number of shooting stars Sam counted compared to the average, and the amount of discount for a shirt, all based on the information given in the questions. Overall, this program is designed to solve math and logical reasoning tasks efficiently by using language models as its main source of information.\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total number of pencils Sarah has. We know that she bought 20 pencils on Monday and 18 more on Tuesday. This means that she has 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she bought triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils.

      "Question: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky.  Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald.  How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the number of shooting stars Sam counted. First, we know that Bridget counted 14 shooting stars. Next, we know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Finally, we know that Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. To find the average number of shooting stars observed, we add up the number of shooting stars each person counted and divide by the number of people, which is 3. So the average number of shooting stars observed is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed.\n",

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program appears to be designed to answer various math and logical reasoning tasks by using language models specifically trained for this task. The program takes in a question and provides instructions for the reasoning process, where the user fills in the blanks to come up with the answer. The program then passes the question to the ChainOfThought module, which uses trained language models to analyze the question's text and produce an answer. This process closely resembles how a human would solve a math or logical reasoning problem. The program in this example successfully calculates the number of pencils Sarah has, the number of shooting stars Sam counted compared to the average, and the amount of discount for a shirt, all based on the information given in the questions. Overall, this program is designed to solve math and logical reasoning tasks efficiently by using language models as its main source of information.\n",

      "TASK DEMO(S):\n",
      "Question: Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. On Wednesday she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday. How many pencils does she have?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total number of pencils Sarah has. We know that she bought 20 pencils on Monday and 18 more on Tuesday. This means that she has 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she bought triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils Sarah has is 38 + 54 = 92.\n",
      "Answer: 92\n",
      "Question: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky.  Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald.  How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the number of shooting stars Sam counted. First, we know that Bridget counted 14 shooting stars. Next, we know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Finally, we know that Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. To find the average number of shooting stars observed, we add up the number of shooting stars each person counted and divide by the number of people, which is 3. So the average number of shooting stars observed is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed.\n",
      "Answer: 2\n",
      "Question: Megan pays $16 for a shirt that costs $22 before sales. What is the amount of the discount?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the amount of the discount. We can subtract the amount Megan paid from the original price of the shirt. This will give us the amount of the discount.\n",

      "task_demos Question: A third of the contestants at a singing competition are female, and the rest are male. If there are 18 contestants in total, how many of them are male?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the number of male contestants. We know that a third of the contestants are female, which means that 2/3 of the contestants are male. We can represent this as 2/3 * total number of contestants = number of male contestants. We also know that the total number of contestants is 18. So, we can set up the equation 2/3 * 18 = number of male contestants. Solving for number of male contestants, we get 12.\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find Margaret's score. First, we need to find Marco's score by subtracting 10% from the average score. Then, we can add 5 points to Marco's score to find Margaret's score.\n",

We know that she scored 70 in Music and 1/10 less in Maths, which means she scored 63 in Maths. We also know that she scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than in Arts, so she scored 83 in Arts. Finally, we know that she got 10 marks more in Social Studies than in Music, so she scored 80 in Social Studies.

This means that she has 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she bought triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils.

How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the number of shooting stars Sam counted. First, we know that Bridget counted 14 shooting stars. Next, we know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Finally, we know that Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. To find the average number of shooting stars observed, we add up the number of shooting stars each person counted and divide by the number of people, which is 3. So the average number of shooting stars observed is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed.\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total number of pencils Sarah has. We know that she bought 20 pencils on Monday and 18 more on Tuesday. This means that she has 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she bought triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils.

How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the number of shooting stars Sam counted. First, we know that Bridget counted 14 shooting stars. Next, we know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Finally, we know that Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. To find the average number of shooting stars observed, we add up the number of shooting stars each person counted and divide by the number of people, which is 3. So the average number of shooting stars observed is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed.\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the number of male contestants. We know that a third of the contestants are female, which means that 2/3 of the contestants are male. We can represent this as 2/3 * total number of contestants = number of male contestants. We also know that the total number of contestants is 18. So, we can set up the equation 2/3 * 18 = number of male contestants. Solving for number of male contestants, we get 12.\n",

This means she scored 70 - (1/10 * 70) = 63 marks in Maths. We also know that she scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than she scored in Arts, so she scored 63 + 20 = 83 marks in Arts. Additionally, she got 10 marks more in Social Studies than she got in Music, so she scored 70 + 10 = 80 marks in Social Studies.

Finally, we know that Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. To find the average number of shooting stars observed, we add up the number of shooting stars each person counted and divide by the number of people, which is 3. So the average number of shooting stars observed is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed.\n",

Finally, we know that Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. To find the average number of shooting stars observed, we add up the number of shooting stars each person counted and divide by the number of people, which is 3.

So the average number of shooting stars observed is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed.\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the number of male contestants. We know that a third of the contestants are female, which means that 2/3 of the contestants are male. We can represent this as 2/3 * total number of contestants = number of male contestants. We also know that the total number of contestants is 18. So, we can set up the equation 2/3 * 18 = number of male contestants. Solving for number of male contestants, we get 12.\n",

Finally, we know that Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. To find the average number of shooting stars observed, we add up the number of shooting stars each person counted and divide by the number of people, which is 3. So the average number of shooting stars observed is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed.\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total number of marks Amaya scored. We know that she scored 70 in Music and 1/10 less in Maths, which means she scored 63 in Maths. We also know that she scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than in Arts, so she scored 83 in Arts. Finally, we know that she got 10 marks more in Social Studies than in Music, so she scored 80 in Social Studies.

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total number of pencils Sarah has. We know that she bought 20 pencils on Monday and 18 more on Tuesday. This means that she has 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she bought triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils.

How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the number of shooting stars Sam counted. First, we know that Bridget counted 14 shooting stars. Next, we know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Finally, we know that Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. To find the average number of shooting stars observed, we add up the number of shooting stars each person counted and divide by the number of people, which is 3. So the average number of shooting stars observed is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed.\n",

We can represent this as 2/3 * total number of contestants = number of male contestants. We also know that the total number of contestants is 18.

Next, we know that she scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than in Arts, so she must have scored 83 in Arts. Finally, we know that she got 10 marks more in Social Studies than in Music, so she must have scored 80 in Social Studies. Therefore, the total number of marks she scored in all subjects is 70 + 63 + 83 + 80 = 296.\n",

First, we know that she scored 70 in Music and 1/10 less in Maths, which means she scored 63 in Maths.

Now, we can substitute the value of Music (70) into the equation for Social Studies to get: Social Studies = 70 + 10 = 80. Finally, we can add up all the marks she scored in each subject to get the total: Maths + Arts + Social Studies + Music = (Arts - 20) + Arts + 80 + 70 = 2Arts + 130.

This means that she has 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she bought triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils.

Finally, we know that Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. To find the average number of shooting stars observed, we add up the number of shooting stars each person counted and divide by the number of people, which is 3. So the average number of shooting stars observed is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed.\n",

Next, we know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Finally, we know that Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. To find the average number of shooting stars observed, we add up the number of shooting stars each person counted and divide by the number of people, which is 3. So the average number of shooting stars observed is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed.\n",

Therefore, the total number of marks she scored in all subjects is 70 + 63 + 83 + 80 = 296.\\nAnswer: 296\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Megan pays $16 for a shirt that costs $22 before sales. What is the amount of the discount?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the amount of the discount. We can subtract the amount Megan paid from the original price of the shirt. This will give us the amount of the discount.\\nAnswer: $6\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. On Wednesday she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday. How many pencils does she have?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total number of pencils Sarah has. We know that she bought 20 pencils on Monday and 18 more on Tuesday. This means that she has 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she bought triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils Sarah has is 38 + 54 = 92.\\nAnswer: 92\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald. How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the number of shooting stars Sam counted. First, we know that Bridget counted 14 shooting stars. Next, we know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Finally, we know that Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. To find the average number of shooting stars observed, we add up the number of shooting stars each person counted and divide by the number of people, which is 3. So the average number of shooting stars observed is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed.\\nAnswer: 2\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: A third of the contestants at a singing competition are female, and the rest are male. If there are 18 contestants in total, how many of them are male?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the number of male contestants. We know that a third of the contestants are female, which means that 2/3 of the contestants are male. We can represent this as 2/3 * total number of contestants = number of male contestants. We also know that the total number of contestants is 18. So, we can set up the equation 2/3 * 18 = number of male contestants. Solving for number of male contestants, we get 12.\\nAnswer: 12\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: 20 birds migrate on a seasonal basis from one lake to another, searching for food. If they fly from lake Jim to lake Disney in one season, which is 50 miles apart, then the next season they fly from lake Disney to lake London, 60 miles apart, calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\\x1b[32m calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled. We know that the birds flew 50 miles from lake Jim to lake Disney and then 60 miles from lake Disney to lake London. This means that in total, they flew 50 + 60 = 110 miles. Since there are 20 birds, we can multiply the total distance by 20 to get the combined distance all of the birds have traveled, which is 110 * 20 = 2200 miles.\\nAnswer: 2200 miles\\x1b[0m\\n\\n\\n\""
