      "Question: 20 birds migrate on a seasonal basis from one lake to another, searching for food. If they fly from lake Jim to lake Disney in one season, which is 50 miles apart, then the next season they fly from lake Disney to lake London, 60 miles apart, calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons.\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m calculate the combined distance traveled by the birds. First, we calculate the distance traveled in the first season, which is 50 miles. Then, we calculate the distance traveled in the second season, which is 60 miles.

Ella got 4 incorrect answers while Marion got 6 more than half the score of Ella. What is Marion's score?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find Marion's score. We know that Ella got 4 incorrect answers, which means she got 36 correct answers. We also know that Marion got 6 more than half of Ella's score, which is 6 more than 36/2 = 18. Therefore, Marion's score is 18 + 6 = 24.\\nAnswer: 24\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald. How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the answer. First, we know that Bridget counted 14 shooting stars. Then, we know that Reginald counted two fewer than Bridget, so he counted 12 shooting stars. Finally, we know that Sam counted four more than Reginald, so he counted 16 shooting stars. To find the average number of shooting stars, we add up the total number of shooting stars (14 + 12 + 16 = 42) and divide by the number of people (3). This gives us an average of 14 shooting stars per person. Since Sam counted 16 shooting stars, he counted 2 more than the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them.\\nAnswer: 2\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. On Wednesday she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday. How many pencils does she have?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the total number of pencils Sarah has. We know that she bought 20 pencils on Monday and 18 more on Tuesday, so she has 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she bought triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils she has is 38 + 54 = 92.\\nAnswer: 92\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Rookie police officers have to buy duty shoes at the full price of $85, but officers who have served at least a year get a 20% discount. Officers who have served at least three years get an additional 25% off the discounted price. How much does an officer who has served at least three years have to pay for shoes?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the final price. First, we calculate the discounted price for an officer who has served at least a year. This is 85 * 0.8 = 68. Then, we calculate the additional discount for an officer who has served at least three years. This is 68 * 0.75 = 51. Finally, the officer has to pay 51 dollars for the shoes.\\nAnswer: 51\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Stephen made 10 round trips up and down a 40,000 foot tall mountain.
