If they fly from lake Jim to lake Disney in one season, which is 50 miles apart, then the next season they fly from lake Disney to lake London, 60 miles apart, calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons.\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled. We know that there are 20 birds and they fly from lake Jim to lake Disney, which is 50 miles apart. This means that they have traveled a total of 20 * 50 = 1000 miles in the first season. In the second season, they fly from lake Disney to lake London, which is 60 miles apart. Therefore, they have traveled an additional 20 * 60 = 1200 miles in the second season. Therefore, the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons is 1000 + 1200 = 2200 miles.\n",

If she scored 70 in Music and scored 1/10 less in Maths, what's the total number of marks she scored in all the subjects?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total number of marks Amaya scored. We know that she scored 70 in Music and 1/10 less in Maths, which means she scored 70 - (1/10 * 70) = 63 in Maths. We also know that she scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than she scored in Arts, which means she scored 63 + 20 = 83 in Arts. Finally, we know that she got 10 marks more in Social Studies than she got in Music, which means she scored 70 + 10 = 80 in Social Studies. Therefore, the total number of marks she scored in all the subjects is 70 + 63 + 83 + 80 = 296.\\nAnswer: 296\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Megan pays $16 for a shirt that costs $22 before sales. What is the amount of the discount?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the discount. We first need to find the difference between the original price and the discounted price. We can do this by subtracting the discounted price from the original price. This gives us $22 - $16 = $6. Therefore, the discount is $6.\\nAnswer: $6\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. On Wednesday she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday. How many pencils does she have?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total number of pencils Sarah has. We know that she bought 20 pencils on Monday and 18 more on Tuesday. This means that she has 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she bought triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils she has is 38 + 54 = 92.\\nAnswer: 92\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald. How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the answer. We know that Bridget counted 14 shooting stars, Reginald counted two fewer than Bridget, and Sam counted four more than Reginald. So, we can calculate the average number of shooting stars by adding the number of shooting stars counted by each of them and dividing by 3. This gives us (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14 shooting stars. Therefore, Sam counted 16 shooting stars, which is 2 more than the average number of shooting stars observed by the three of them.\\nAnswer: 2\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: The result from the 40-item Statistics exam Marion and Ella took already came out.

If they fly from lake Jim to lake Disney in one season, which is 50 miles apart, then the next season they fly from lake Disney to lake London, 60 miles apart, calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons.\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons. We first need to calculate the distance traveled by the birds in the first season, which is from lake Jim to lake Disney. Since there are 20 birds, and the distance between the two lakes is 50 miles, the total distance traveled by the birds in the first season is 20 x 50 = 1000 miles. Next, we need to calculate the distance traveled by the birds in the second season, which is from lake Disney to lake London. Since there are still 20 birds, and the distance between the two lakes is 60 miles, the total distance traveled by the birds in the second season is 20 x 60 = 1200 miles. Therefore, the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons is 1000 + 1200 = 2200 miles.\n",

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program seems to be designed to solve mathematics word problems, where the solution requires multiple steps of logic and calculation. It works by taking the given question and providing both the solution as well as a reasoning explanation of each of the steps, facilitating a step by step thought process to reach the correct answer. This is done by using strings in a specific format and calling language models that specialize in solving these types of tasks, chains of thought (CoTs). With each input question, this program outputs a correct answer followed by a thought-out reasoning process, which essentially explains the necessary calculations and steps needed to follow to reach the desired answer. The pseudocode provided above is a shell for the program, and some extra adjustments and function calls may need to be included in order to fully run depending on the platform the program is used on.

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program seems to be designed to solve mathematics word problems, where the solution requires multiple steps of logic and calculation. It works by taking the given question and providing both the solution as well as a reasoning explanation of each of the steps, facilitating a step by step thought process to reach the correct answer. This is done by using strings in a specific format and calling language models that specialize in solving these types of tasks, chains of thought (CoTs). With each input question, this program outputs a correct answer followed by a thought-out reasoning process, which essentially explains the necessary calculations and steps needed to follow to reach the desired answer. The pseudocode provided above is a shell for the program, and some extra adjustments and function calls may need to be included in order to fully run depending on the platform the program is used on.

It takes in a question and uses chain of thought visualization steps (most likely using language models) to produce a potential answer and an explanation for how this answer can be derived. The instructions suggest that the program is created to help users think step by step to reach the answer for a given question. In the example provided, each question involves a problem or puzzle with certain constraints or conditions, and the program presents a systematic approach to solving the problem and arriving at the correct answer. It seems the program is leveraging language models to guide users through the thought process needed to arrive at the answer for the task at hand.\n",

It takes in a question and uses chain of thought visualization steps (most likely using language models) to produce a potential answer and an explanation for how this answer can be derived. The instructions suggest that the program is created to help users think step by step to reach the answer for a given question. In the example provided, each question involves a problem or puzzle with certain constraints or conditions, and the program presents a systematic approach to solving the problem and arriving at the correct answer. It seems the program is leveraging language models to guide users through the thought process needed to arrive at the answer for the task at hand.\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m determine the amount of the discount. We first have to apply the 20% discount for officers who have served at least a year.

Next, we have to apply the additional 25% discount for officers who have served at least three years. This is calculated by multiplying $68 by 0.25, which comes out to $17. Thus, the discount at this stage is $17 + $17 = $34. However, this $17 is off the discounted price of $68, not the original price of $85.

Officers who have served at least three years get an additional 25% off the discounted price. How much does an officer who has served at least three years have to pay for shoes?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m calculate the final price that a police officer who has served at least three years would have to pay for their duty shoes. First, we need to determine the discounted price after the 20% off is applied. Next, we need to calculate the additional 25% discount on that discounted price. We can do this by taking the additional 25% of the difference between the original price and the discounted price, and then subtracting that amount from the discounted price.

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m calculate the price for the officer who has served at least three years. First, we start with the basic price of $85 for duty shoes. Then, we apply the 20% discount for officers who have served at least a year. So, the officer will pay $85 - (20%*$85) = $85 - $17 = $68. Now we are left with the discounted price. As the officer has served at least three years, another 25% can be taken off from the $68. So, the final price will be $68 * (100% - 25%) = $68 * (75/100) = $51.\n",
