If they fly from lake Jim to lake Disney in one season, which is 50 miles apart, then the next season they fly from lake Disney to lake London, 60 miles apart, calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons.\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled. We know that there are 20 birds and they fly from lake Jim to lake Disney, which is 50 miles apart. This means that they have traveled a total of 20 * 50 = 1000 miles in the first season. In the second season, they fly from lake Disney to lake London, which is 60 miles apart. Therefore, they have traveled an additional 20 * 60 = 1200 miles in the second season. Therefore, the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons is 1000 + 1200 = 2200 miles.\n",

If she scored 70 in Music and scored 1/10 less in Maths, what's the total number of marks she scored in all the subjects?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total number of marks Amaya scored. We know that she scored 70 in Music and 1/10 less in Maths, which means she scored 70 - (1/10 * 70) = 63 in Maths. We also know that she scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than she scored in Arts, which means she scored 63 + 20 = 83 in Arts. Finally, we know that she got 10 marks more in Social Studies than she got in Music, which means she scored 70 + 10 = 80 in Social Studies. Therefore, the total number of marks she scored in all the subjects is 70 + 63 + 83 + 80 = 296.\\nAnswer: 296\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Megan pays $16 for a shirt that costs $22 before sales. What is the amount of the discount?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the discount. We first need to find the difference between the original price and the discounted price. We can do this by subtracting the discounted price from the original price. This gives us $22 - $16 = $6. Therefore, the discount is $6.\\nAnswer: $6\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Sarah buys 20 pencils on Monday. Then she buys 18 more pencils on Tuesday. On Wednesday she buys triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday. How many pencils does she have?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total number of pencils Sarah has. We know that she bought 20 pencils on Monday and 18 more on Tuesday. This means that she has 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she bought triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils she has is 38 + 54 = 92.\\nAnswer: 92\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky. Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald. How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the answer. We know that Bridget counted 14 shooting stars, Reginald counted two fewer than Bridget, and Sam counted four more than Reginald. So, we can calculate the average number of shooting stars by adding the number of shooting stars counted by each of them and dividing by 3. This gives us (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14 shooting stars. Therefore, Sam counted 16 shooting stars, which is 2 more than the average number of shooting stars observed by the three of them.\\nAnswer: 2\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: The result from the 40-item Statistics exam Marion and Ella took already came out.

      "Question: 20 birds migrate on a seasonal basis from one lake to another, searching for food. If they fly from lake Jim to lake Disney in one season, which is 50 miles apart, then the next season they fly from lake Disney to lake London, 60 miles apart, calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons.\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m calculate the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons. We first need to calculate the distance traveled by the birds in the first season, which is from lake Jim to lake Disney. Since there are 20 birds, and the distance between the two lakes is 50 miles, the total distance traveled by the birds in the first season is 20 x 50 = 1000 miles. Next, we need to calculate the distance traveled by the birds in the second season, which is from lake Disney to lake London. Since there are still 20 birds, and the distance between the two lakes is 60 miles, the total distance traveled by the birds in the second season is 20 x 60 = 1200 miles. Therefore, the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons is 1000 + 1200 = 2200 miles.\n",

Its specific task appears to be solving simple mathematical word problems that require a bit of reasoning and basic calculation. The program takes in a question and produces a solution by first breaking down the information in the question and then using mathematical operations to arrive at the answer. It also provides a short phrase for how it arrived at the solution.

Then, Jane gave 1/2 to Joe and Darcy, so the total amount of slices going to them is 4/2 which equals 4. Next, she gave 1/4 to Carl which is written as 4 x 1/4. Multiplying fractions can be done by multiplying their top and bottom numbers, which gets us 4/16. Simplifying would give 1/4 slices to Carl.

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m ${produce the answer}. First, we need to half the pie by dividing 8 pieces into 2. That gives 4 slices. Then, Jane gave 1/2 to Joe and Darcy, so the total amount of slices going to them is 4/2 which equals 4. Next, she gave 1/4 to Carl which is written as 4 x 1/4. Multiplying fractions can be done by multiplying their top and bottom numbers, which gets us 4/16. Simplifying would give 1/4 slices to Carl. To find the number of slices leftover, we substract from the 4 original slices with 2 going to Joe and Darcy, and 1 to Carl, leaving us with 1 slice remaining.\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m solve this. We first need to remember that 1/2 is the same as dividing by 2. Therefore, if Nancy gave away 1/2 of the pie, she is left with 1/8 of the original pie. 1/4 can also be reduced to 1/2. So if Nancy also gave 1/2 of the pie to Carl, she is left with 1/4 of the original pie. Now if we add up 1/8 and 1/4, we now know that there are 3/8 pieces remaining.
