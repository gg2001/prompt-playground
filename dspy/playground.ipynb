      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total number of marks Amaya scored. We know that she scored 70 in Music and 1/10 less in Maths, which means she scored 70 - (1/10 * 70) = 63 in Maths. We also know that she scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than she scored in Arts, which means she scored 63 + 20 = 83 in Arts. Finally, we know that she got 10 marks more in Social Studies than she got in Music, which means she scored 70 + 10 = 80 in Social Studies. Therefore, the total number of marks she scored in all the subjects is 70 + 63 + 83 + 80 = 296.\n",

This means that she has 20 + 18 = 38 pencils. On Wednesday, she bought triple the number of pencils she did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pencils.

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the answer. We know that Bridget counted 14 shooting stars, Reginald counted two fewer than Bridget, and Sam counted four more than Reginald. So, we can calculate the average number of shooting stars by adding the number of shooting stars counted by each of them and dividing by 3. This gives us (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14 shooting stars.

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to calculate the total number of marks Amaya scored. We know that she scored 70 in Music and 1/10 less in Maths, which means she scored 63 in Maths. We also know that she got 10 marks more in Social Studies than she got in Music, which means she scored 80 in Social Studies. Finally, we know that she scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than she scored in Arts, which means she scored 83 in Arts.

How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the answer. First, we know that Bridget counted 14 shooting stars. Then, we know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Finally, we know that Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. To find the average number of shooting stars observed, we add up the number of shooting stars each person counted and divide by the number of people, which is 3. So, the average number of shooting stars observed is (14 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number of shooting stars observed.\n",

      "Question: A third of the contestants at a singing competition are female, and the rest are male. If there are 18 contestants in total, how many of them are male?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to figure out the number of male contestants. We know that there are 18 contestants in total, and one-third of them are female. This means that two-thirds of the contestants are male. To find the number of male contestants, we multiply two-thirds by the total number of contestants. So we multiple 2 by 18 and then divide it by 3. This gives us 12 male contestants.\n",

      "Question: Amaya scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than she scored in Arts. She also got 10 marks more in Social Studies than she got in Music. If she scored 70 in Music and scored 1/10 less in Maths, what's the total number of marks she scored in all the subjects?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m find the Amaya's total marks. First, we know that she scored 70 marks in Music. Next, we are told that she got 10 marks more in Social Studies than in Music, meaning she got 70+10=80 marks in Social Studies.

      "Question: Amaya scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than she scored in Arts. She also got 10 marks more in Social Studies than she got in Music. If she scored 70 in Music and scored 1/10 less in Maths, what's the total number of marks she scored in all the subjects?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m determine Amaya's total marks based on the given information. We can start by assigning variables to each subject - Arts (A), Music (M), Maths (M1), and Social Studies (SS). From the given information, we know that M1 = (0.9)M and SS = M + 10. We also know that a total of M1 + M + SS + A adds up to an unknown total which we will try to find.\n",
      "Answer: Following this information, we can replace M from M1 and SS from SS=M+10. Now let's substitute all these variables in the final equation - (0.9M) + (0.9M-20) + M + (M+20), which equals 183 marks. Therefore, Amaya scored 183 marks in all subjects.\u001b[0m\n",

The example of the program above is being used to solve math problems by parsing the question and reasoning, and then using that information to produce the answer.

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The program is a pipeline that utilizes language models to solve tasks involving word problems or math problems where multi-step reasoning and calculation is required. The program takes in a question and uses a chain of thought approach to break down the question and generate a rationale and solution. It provides instructions for completing the task and has fields for input question, reasoning/rationale, and output answer. The program works by breaking down the reasoning process into smaller steps and using language models to generate coherent explanations for each step. This allows for students to think step by step towards a solution while also providing a clear and understandable rationale for how leading to the computer-generated answer.\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find Margaret's score. We need to first find the average. Since the average was 90, if Marco scored 10% less than that, he scored (10/ 100) * (90) = 9 points less. Therefore, Marco's score was (90 - 9) = 81. Since Margaret's score was 5 more than Marco's, her score was (81 + 5) = 86.\n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m determine the amount of the discount. We first have to apply the 20% discount for officers who have served at least a year.

Next, we have to apply the additional 25% discount for officers who have served at least three years. This is calculated by multiplying $68 by 0.25, which comes out to $17. Thus, the discount at this stage is $17 + $17 = $34. However, this $17 is off the discounted price of $68, not the original price of $85.

      "Question: Rookie police officers have to buy duty shoes at the full price of $85, but officers who have served at least a year get a 20% discount. Officers who have served at least three years get an additional 25% off the discounted price. How much does an officer who has served at least three years have to pay for shoes?\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m calculate the final price that a police officer who has served at least three years would have to pay for their duty shoes. First, we need to determine the discounted price after the 20% off is applied. Next, we need to calculate the additional 25% discount on that discounted price. We can do this by taking the additional 25% of the difference between the original price and the discounted price, and then subtracting that amount from the discounted price.
