      "The first two Buick automobiles were made in 1899 and 1900 at the \"Buick Auto-Vim and Power Company\" by chief-engineer Walter Lorenzo Marr, but company owner David Dunbar Buick was reluctant to begin making automobiles, being satisfied with stationary and marine engine production, so Marr left Buick in 1901 to found Marr (automobile) under his own name. His replacement was Eugene Richard, who applied for a patent in 1902 for Marrs valve-in-head (Overhead valve engine) engine, which patent, number 771,095, was awarded to Richard in the name of Buick in 1904. In 1903, the third Buick automobile was made, this time by Richard, but in 1904 Buick, whose company was now called \"Buick Motor Company,\" moved to Flint, Michigan, and Richard stayed behind. Marr was rehired in Flint as chief engineer, to begin making automobiles in production. That year, 37 Buick automobiles were made, production increasing to 750 in 1905, 1,400 in 1906, 4,641 in 1907, and 8,800 in 1908, taking the number one spot away from close competitors Oldsmobile, Ford Motor Company, and Maxwell automobile.
